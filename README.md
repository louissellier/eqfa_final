## ðŸ§  Overview

This project investigates whether forensic accounting insightsâ€”specifically the **Beneish M-Score**â€”can be used not only to detect potential earnings manipulation, but also to construct equity portfolios that outperform the market.

Using financial statement data from the **CFA Institute Level II curriculum dataset** and return data from **Alpha Vantage**, we:

- Compute M-Scores for a representative sample of U.S. firms (2001â€“2022)
- Run firm-level regressions to test whether M-Scores explain returns beyond market beta
- Build equally weighted portfolios based on M-Score rankings and compare them to the S&P 500
